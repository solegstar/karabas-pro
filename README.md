**Yet another FPGA ZX Spectrum clone ;)**

## Intro

ZX Spectrum compatible machine with a soft CPU, FDD and HDD (CF card) controllers, PS/2 keyboard/mouse, VGA output and all logic inside the Altera FPGA **EP4CE6**.

## The idea

The idea was to make a smaller Profi (Профи) ZX Spectrum clone, with real FDD and HDD controllers. The board size should fit the dimensions of the real 3.5" floppy drive. 

## Firmwares

**The main firmware is still in progress. Currently it implements:**

1) ZX Spectrum classic and profi hi-res hi-color mode (with palette) (512x240)
2) ZX Profi CMR ports
3) FDD controller that works both in CP/M and classic modes
4) HDD controller (works only in Profi CP/M mode)
5) PS/2 keyboard (XT keyboard emulation)
6) PS/2 mouse (kempston mouse and serial MS mouse emulation)
7) VGA output (requires a monitor with 50Hz support)
8) Turbosound (2 x AY-3-8912), Soundrive and SAA1099
9) Kempston joystick support
10) RTC (profi), emulated read-only yet, set time via atmega UART
11) SD card access via Z-Controller emulation

**The things that should be implemented (means a TODO list):**

1) Wi-Fi support in TR-DOS and CP/M modes
2) RTC ports read/write to set time from the profi interface
3) Simple UART via Atmega
